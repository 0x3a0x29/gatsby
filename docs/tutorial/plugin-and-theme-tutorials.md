title: Plugin & Theme Tutorials

**Gatsby plugins** are Node.js packages that implement Gatsby APIs and are commonly installed through a registry like npm. Common use cases for Gatsby plugins include data sourcing and hooking into lifecycle methods.

**Gatsby themes** are a type of plugin that includes a `gatsby-config.js` file and adds pre-configured functionality, data sourcing, and/or UI code to Gatsby sites. Themes might pre-bundle plugins and configure them so users don't have to, providing a nice abstraction that can be installed and updated as a package.

> For more information, you can refer to the [conceptual guide on plugins, themes, and starters](/docs/plugins-themes-and-starters/).

In this section, you'll find tutorials for:

1. Creating source and transformer plugins
1. Setting up a site using a single theme (the blog theme)
1. Setting up a site which composes multiple themes (the blog theme, and the notes theme)

To learn more about plugins and themes in general, you may be interested to check out the [plugins section](/docs/plugins/) and [themes section](/docs/themes/) of the docs, as well.
